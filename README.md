# EECS 281 Projects - Data Structures and Algorithms

I developed a series of complex software projects as part of **EECS 281**, an undergraduate course at the University of Michigan focusing on **data structures** and **algorithms**. These projects involved solving real-world problems by implementing advanced algorithms and optimizing data structures for efficiency.

### Projects and Data Structures Used:

1. **2D and 3D Environments and Puzzles**  
   - **Data Structures Used:** Graphs (adjacency lists), Queues, Stacks  
   - **Description:** Utilized graphs for route tracing in 2D and 3D environments, leveraging **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** for puzzle-solving.

2. **Zombie Tower Defense**  
   - **Data Structures Used:** Priority Queues, Templated Containers, Inheritance, Interface Programming  
   - **Description:** Implemented **priority queues** to manage task execution in a game simulation, working with **templated containers** and applying **object-oriented principles** like inheritance and interfaces.

3. **Bank Simulation**  
   - **Data Structures Used:** Hash Tables  
   - **Description:** Employed **hash tables** for efficient data retrieval in a banking system simulation, managing account data and transactions.

4. **Zoo Optimization Algorithms**  
   - **Data Structures Used:** Dynamic Programming Tables, Custom Containers  
   - **Description:** Worked with **dynamic programming** and **custom containers** to solve optimization problems such as the **Traveling Salesperson** and **Knapsack problem**.

### Disclaimer:

In compliance with the University of Michigan's honor code, I cannot publicly share the source code. However, detailed descriptions of each projectâ€™s key functionalities and the technical concepts applied are provided above to highlight my technical expertise and problem-solving skills.
